# josephcrosmanplays532 GoAPI
This is an API wrapper for GoAnimate, which had shut down *on december 19 2019*.	Unlike other services that attempt to sole the same problem, this project allows the LVM to access data peristence and is very portable.  Please keep in mind that not all features designed to run on the original API work properly.
## How to Use
Can't tell you. this API server is ment for my domain. you can use the launcher <a href="https://github.com/josephcrosmanplays532/josephcrosmanplays532.github.io-launcher">here</a>.
